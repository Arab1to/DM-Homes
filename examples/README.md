# DialogRules

DialogRules is a Paper plugin using the new Dialog feature introduced in Minecraft 1.21.6/7 to display Server rules.

## IMPORTANT

This plugin uses the experimental Dialog API of Paper 1.21.7, meaning there can be breaking changes in the future without notice.  
The plugin also only works for Paper builds 17 and newer for 1.21.7 due to the Dialog API not being implemented in older versions!

## Features

- Display Server rules using a Confirmation or Notice Dialog when the user joins the server or executes `/rules`
  - Supports displaying an item with Custom data (model data, enchant glint, etc.)
- Perform actions for when the user clicks the Accept or Deny Buttons.
- Remembers when a User has accepted the Server rules, to not show them again on future joins.
